## Description

A program that parses a book from Project Gutenburg and provides statistics based on it.

The program will provide the most common words from the text passed to the program,
however a CSV file can also be passed to the program to exclude any desired words from
the statistics, essentially blacklisting them.

## Usage

./parse (path to book) (CSV file)
